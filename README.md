# WebCamSFML
This is a program written in c++ to experience the use of ESCAPI (Extremely Simple Capture API) and the SFML library (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) as a graphics interface.

## ESCAPI
This is a library amde by jarikomppa and its github repository is: https://github.com/jarikomppa/escapi

## To Compile
1. ESCAPI needs a dll file (it is included in the repositry). The dll file will only work if you compile in 64x not in 32x (86x). For that reason, you will need to have the 64x SFML library version from here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php  
2. Put Escapi in the same directory of main.cpp
3. Put SFML library in the Solution Directory and link it in the solution.
4. Once you have finished all of that you can compile it now.
